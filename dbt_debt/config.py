Snowflake's ACCOUNT_USAGE and Databricks' query-history and lineage system tables both document
a year. BigQuery's INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS is documented at 180 days, which is also the default
window, so it only ever bites on an explicit over-ask. Redshift is the odd one: AWS documents
seven days for the older STL views and states no retention at all for the SYS views, so seven is
a conservative floor rather than a measurement of what any account holds. `next_steps.md` tracks
the experiment measuring it.

This bounds what the report *claims* to have seen, so a model queried less often than the real
window is not silently called unused. It deliberately does not bound what the adapters ask the
warehouse for, and it does not need to: a warehouse cannot return history it no longer holds, so
asking for 400 days returns exactly what asking for the retained window would. On Redshift that
distinction is load-bearing, because AWS states no SYS retention and an account may keep more
than the floor, so clamping the queries could discard evidence we would otherwise have. See the
comment above `RealRedshiftClient.table_usage`.
